Problem Statement : 
	Write a java Program to create an array by size taking from the user and store the elements from the user.
	Also take a key to be searched in the array by the using Binary Search. Write the Logic of the Binary Search 
	in the Binary search method accepts two parameters array and key. And returns a string value that key 
	is present at index or key is not present. Method has to be Static method.
	
Explanation : 
	At First we will create an array of length given by the user.The elements which are to be stored in that 
	created array also given by the user. Then the Key element which should be searched among the array is given
	by the user. Now we perform to calculate the mid value by considering the low and high values. If the key 
	value is matches to mid value then prints a message as key found. If key is greater than the mid then re-assign 
	the low value as mid+1 and re-calculate the mid and if key is less than the mid re-assigning of high value with
	mid-1;
