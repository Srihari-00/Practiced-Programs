Problem Statement : 
	Write a java program to take array length as input from user and
	create an integer array and store elements into the array by 
	taking elements as input from keyboard. Before Swapping print the contents
	of array Ask user to enter 2 indexes. Swap the the values of 2 indexes 
	After swapping print the contents of array.
	
	Sample input output:
	Before swapping : Arr--> 10 20 30 40 50
	After Swapping : Arr-->10 30 20 40 50
	
Explanation : 
	We will create an array of length given by the user as input. The elements which are 
	given by the user will be stored into the array. Here we have to perform the swapping 
	operation on values in the indexes by taking the indexes as input from the user that are
	supposed to be swapped. We have to display the elements of the array before
	and after swapping the values in the indexes.
