Problem Statement :
	Write a program to find the cube root of a number. (use Math.cbrt())
	
Explanation :
	Firstly, the program will accept an integer value that the user wants to calculate the 
	cube root of a number and storing that number in a variable. By using the in-built math.crbt() function
	the program calculates the cube root of a number and returns the result on to the console.
