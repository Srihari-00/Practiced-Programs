Problem Statement :
	Write a program to find the sum of the digits of a number until the sum
	becomes a single digit.
	
Explanation : 
	The program accepts an integer value from the user as input and store it in a int variable num.
	By using the while loop, if the number is greater than 9, to check whether the number is single digit or not.
	if not then initializing a variable sum=0,again check another condition if the number is greater than 0 then 
	perform the task. Add the remainder of the number when divided by 10 to the sum and assign the value to the
	sum. Now divide the number by 10, assign the resulted quotient to the num. This task will loop until (num>0)
	fails. Now assigning the sum value to the num. After the condition (num>9) fails, Display the num value onto 
	the console.
