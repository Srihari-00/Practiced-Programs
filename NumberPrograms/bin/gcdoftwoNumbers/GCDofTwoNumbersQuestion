Problem Statement :
	Write a java program to find the GCD of two numbers.
	
Explanation :
	We accept two numbers of int type from the user as input. Initializing the GCD as 1. By using the for loop
	where i is the number to check its GCD and must be less than the both the two numbers. If both the numbers divisible
	by the number I and gives the remainder value as 0.then the highest number will be considered as its GCD by
	assigning the I value to the GCD. And it displays the GCD on to the console.
