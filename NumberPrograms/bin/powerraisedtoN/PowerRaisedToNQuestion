Problem Statement :
	Write a java program to print the result of a number when it is raised to power
	n.
	
Explanation :
	The program will accept two interger values from the user as input. One integer value as The base number and
	stores in a variable num1 And the second integer value as power/exponent and stores in a variable num2. By 
	using the inbuilt Math.pow function we calculate the power for the given input. The result will gives
	the long datatype, so here explicit typecasting has to be done.For that we have convert the data type
	manually forcefully into int data type And The result is displayed to the console.
