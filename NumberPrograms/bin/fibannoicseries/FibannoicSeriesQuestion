Problem Statement :
	Write a program to print the Fibonacci series up to n terms.
	
Explanation :
	We take a number n from the user as input. Consider that number as a Range. Now we have to print the fibonocci
	series upto n terms.For that initializing the first value will always be 0 in fib1 and second term will be 1
	in fib2 creating a third variable fib3. If the number(count) is equal to 1 then print fib1. If the number(count)
	is equal to 2, then print fib1 and fib2. If the count is other than this, then print fib1 and fib2 and also
	store the addition result of fib1 and fib2 in the third variable fib3. And perform the swapping operation among
	the three variables and print fib3 only until the n number terms.
