Problem Statement :
	Write a program to print the sum of squares from 1 to n numbers.
	
Explanation :
	We accept an integer value from the user as input and store it in a variable num.
	where num is the end number(range). Initializing the sum=0. By using the for loop i starts from the 1 to
	num. Performing the square calculation(i*i) and stores in a variable Result by initializing.
	Adding the result to the sum and assign the value to the sum. Prints the squares of each Number.
	After the for loop fails then print the sum of squares of the numbers.
