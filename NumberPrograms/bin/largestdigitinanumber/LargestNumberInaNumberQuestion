Problem Statement :
	Write a java program to find the largest digit in a number.
	
Explanation : 
	The Program will accepts a number from the user as input and store it in a variable(num).
	The remainder of the number(num) when divided by the 10 will be stored in a variable Largest_digit.
	using the while loop only when the number(num) is greater than 10 only. The number is divided by the 10 and 
	assigning the result to the Number(num). Now the remainder of the num divided by 10 is stored in a variable 
	called Digit. if the digit is greater than the largest_digit, then assign the digit value to the Largest_digit.
	This while loop will continue until the condition fail. Atlast the program will print the Largest_digit
	of a Number.
