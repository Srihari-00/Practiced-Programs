Problem Statement :
	Write a program to print the armstrong numbers in range from 1 to n.
	
Explanation : 
	The program will accept a number and store it in a variable.we Initializing a variable is equal to 0. By
	using the for loop, we start checking the all the numbers untill n numbers entered by the user.
	Using the while loop, if the number is greater than 0, store the remainder value when the number is divided
	by 10 and store the result in variable called digit. Adding the cube of digit to the sum and assigning to the 
	sum. Assigning the quotient of the number divided by 10 to number. Continue this loop until the while condition 
	fails. Then if the sum is equal to the original number, then display the "Number is Armstrong Number". Otherwise
	prints "Number is not an Armstrong Number".
