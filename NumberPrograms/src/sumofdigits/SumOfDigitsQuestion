Problem Statement :
	Write a program to find the sum of the digits of a number..
	
Explanation : 
	The program accepts an integer value from the user as input and store it in a int variable num.
	By using the while loop, if not then initializing a variable sum=0,again check another condition
	if the number is greater than 0 then perform the task. Add the remainder of the number when divided
	by 10 to the sum and assign the value to the sum. Now divide the number by 10, assign the resulted
