Explanation : 
	The program should accepts a sentence as a string from the user. Then convert the string into 
	String type of array by using the split() method. Now the no.of Words present is equals to the length
	of the array. Displaying the total no.of words as the length of the array. By using the for Loop
	the words were displayed according to their indexes.By using the for loop traversing the string array.
	Converting the string at each index into character type array. Displaying the count of letters in each word
	present in the sentence as character array length.
