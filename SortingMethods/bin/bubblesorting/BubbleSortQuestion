Problem Statement :
	Write a Java Program to create an array of length as user input. And store the elements into the array.
	The Program should perform the bubble sorting method. Display the Array before sorting and after sorting on
	to the console.
	
Explanation : 
	We will be creating an array of the length as per user input. Now storing the elements into the array
	by the user input. By using the Enhanced for loop, displaying the array before sorting. Now using the for 
	loop we use 'I' as number of iterations and 'j' as indexes.Now performing the swapping operation if the element
	is greater than the elements of corresponding index. If not index value will be incremented.After performing 
	the Bubble sort, Again displaying the Array as Sorted array on to the console.
